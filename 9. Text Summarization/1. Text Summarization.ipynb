Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination.
