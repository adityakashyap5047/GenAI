He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed.

      "2. **Empower Villages:** Recognizing rural areas as crucial for growth, citing the Periyar PURA initiative as an example of successful local development. This model, supported by self-help groups and technological expertise, has transformed villages by creating employment opportunities, developing wastelands, and fostering entrepreneurship. It has helped rural communities develop internationally competitive products through collaboration with organizations like JETRO.\n",
      "3. **Harness Rural Competence:** Mobilizing rural talent for national competitiveness through initiatives like Periyar PURA which provide urban amenities in rural areas, leading to economic connectivity and employment generation. \n",
      "4. **Seed to Food:** Emphasizing agriculture as a fundamental pillar for growth and development. He highlights the importance of sustainable agricultural practices and the need to strengthen the agricultural sector, inspired by his meetings with farmers and agricultural scientists.  He believes in empowering farmers to protect and nurture fertile land for a second green revolution, aiming to double agricultural production while reducing land, water, and manpower.  \n",
      "5. **Overcome Challenges:** Fostering a spirit of resilience and success, evident in his interaction with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man who despite his physical disabilities, radiated joy and positivity.  Kalam shares the story of how Krishna Murthy, despite his challenges, found joy and success in music, inspiring others with his talent and perseverance.  \n",
      "6. **Collaborative Solutions:**  Promoting partnerships to address problems.\n",
      "7. **Courage in Adversity:**  Building resilience in the face of calamities. Kalam illustrates this point with detailed accounts of his visits to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, devastated by an earthquake, and Chuckchucha village in Car Nicobar Islands, struck by the 2004 Tsunami.  He highlights the spirit of the people who, despite their losses, worked with relief organizations and rebuilt their lives. He even composed a poem \"Sea Waves\" in tribute to the Car Nicobar islanders' indomitable spirit. \n",
      "8. **Connectivity for Transformation:**  Leveraging technology for societal change.
